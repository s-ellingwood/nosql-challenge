# NoSQL Challenge

## Background

### **Instructions**
The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. You've been contracted by the editors of a food magazine, *Eat Safe, Love*, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.

****Part 1:**** The magazine editors have some requested modifications for the database before you can perform any queries or analysis for them. Import the data and make those changes.

**Part 2:** *Eat Safe, Love* has specific questions they want you to answer, which will help them find the locations they wish to visit and avoid. Use the following questions to explore the database, and find the answers, so you can provide them to the magazine editors:

- Which establishments have a hygiene score equal to 20?
- Which establishments in London have a RatingValue greater than or equal to 4?
- What are the top 5 establishments with a RatingValue of 5, sorted by lowest hygiene score, nearest to the new restaurant added, “Penang Flavours”?
- How many establishments in each Local Authority area have a hygiene score of 0? Sort the results from highest to lowest, and print out the top ten local authority areas.
